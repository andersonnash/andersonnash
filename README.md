# Hey there, I'm Nash! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital playground! I'm a Software Engineer at Pipespool Services, weaving magic with Ruby on Rails, testing the limits with RSpec, and architecting databases with PostgreSQL.

## What I'm Up To

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making the web a better place with `Ruby on Rails`.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about `Docker`, `Python`, and `React` - because why stop at being great when you can be phenomenal?
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects that make a difference, or just to geek out on code.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering `React`. Thereâ€™s always a new mountain to climb.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about `Ruby on Rails`, my latest climb, or the best true crime books. Iâ€™m all ears for a thrilling story or a coding challenge.
